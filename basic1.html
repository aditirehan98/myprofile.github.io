                Talking about me technical skills. I can code in different languages like C, C++, Java. I love to design
                beautiful and responsive web pages using HTML, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery. I also know basics of Hibernate
                and Spring. I recently learnt Angular. Specifically, Java is the language which defines me. I am further working on some more languages and platforms to grind my
                technical skills. Apart from these, I love to play badminton and listen songs especially english.

            1. E-commerce Application: It is an e-commerce website where I have included hard-coded data values from backend.  For UI, Angular8 is used and backend is built using spring Initializer and hibernate. The main functionalities added are Login and Sign Up credentials and all other basic functionalities that one finds in e-commerce apps.
            </p>
    <p class="p2">    2. Blogs Website: In this website, Angular8 is used for UI and backend is built using Spring Initializer and hibernate. Other than Login and Sign Up, one can also follow and unfollow different users. One can also see your following and followers in your profile page which can be updated.
        One can also delete and add blogs.</p>
